# Why we need to study Machine Learning

1. How machine learning would help my career?
Machine learning evolves from artificial intelligence and study of pattern recognition. Today, when excessively huge amounts of data are being dealt with everyday, rather every moment, pattern recognition is something that helps large corporations and websites work magnificently with the users. Artificial intelligence has become a favourite with the customers, esp. intelligent personal assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft Cortana, etc. 

Under machine learning, as the name suggests, the machine learns from a given set of algorithms and intensive as well as extensive test cases. Based on user choices, the e-shopping sites or social networking sites display 'recommendations', which is all a part of machine learning, and is quite a revolution these days. So you definitely don't have to worry about the career choices. Most of the computer giants are working in this field. So you may just end up with a really good corporation, maybe the one of your choice as a CS undergraduate, for excelling in machine learning!

2. Who is a suitable candidate to learn this subject?
This field intensively deals with mathematics, for analysis of data and algorithms. 'You' should be quite a suitable candidate yourself (if you paid enough attention in the maths classes)! A good mathematical background is a must and we engineers definitely excel at that! If you have had a mathematical background at school and covered engineering mathematics, you're good to go! Maybe you could just brush up the topics.

3. What are the prerequisites to learn machine learning?
Some mathematical topics you should know:
i) linear algebra
ii) probability theory
iii) calculus
iv) statistics
v) calculus of variations
vi) graph theory
vii) optimization methods (Lagrange multipliers)

The Stanford course CS229 on Machine Learning mentions the following prerequisites:
Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
Familiarity with the basic probability theory. (CS109 or Stat116 is sufficient but not necessary.)
Familiarity with the basic linear algebra (any one of Math 51, Math 103, Math 113, or CS 205 would be much more than necessary.)

You can also visit the same page at Machine Learning (Course Information) for more information.
Another useful link maybe What are the prerequisites for studying Machine Learning? This link also mentions some other Machine Learning libraries and links to more background texts on the subject.

4. How should I go about learning this course?
At first, I would suggest talking to professors and seniors who are already a part of machine learning projects. They should guide you enough about it.

There are various courses available online and I particularly love the ones provided by Stanford University. Here's a link to Coursera where you can find some and choose one yourself: Page on coursera.org.

You can also keep a track of workshops and seminars being organized near you, on machine learning. Attending such seminars and workshops often gives you a practical insight into the subject and comes as quite a motivation! 
That's it!
I hope you now have a direction and wish that you will work towards it! Develop something really cool! Best wishes and good luck!
