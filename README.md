# Why we need to study Machine Learning

## 1. How machine learning would help my career?

   Machine learning evolves from artificial intelligence and study of pattern recognition. Today, when excessively huge amounts of data are being dealt with everyday, rather every moment, pattern recognition is something that helps large corporations and websites work magnificently with the users. Artificial intelligence has become a favourite with the customers, esp. intelligent personal assistants like Apple's Siri, Microsoft Cortana, etc. 
   
   Under machine learning, as the name suggests, the machine learns from a given set of algorithms and intensive as well as extensive test cases. Based on user choices, the e-shopping sites or social networking sites display 'recommendations', which is all a part of machine learning, and is quite a revolution these days. So you definitely don't have to worry about the career choices. Most of the computer giants are working in this field. So you may just end up with a really good corporation, maybe the one of your choice as a CS undergraduate, for excelling in machine learning!

## 2. Who is a suitable candidate to learn this subject?

   This field intensively deals with mathematics, for analysis of data and algorithms. 'You' should be quite a suitable candidate yourself (if you paid enough attention in the maths classes)! A good mathematical background is a must and we engineers definitely excel at that! If you have had a mathematical background at school and covered engineering mathematics, you're good to go! Maybe you could just brush up the topics.

## 3. What are the prerequisites to learn machine learning?

   **Some mathematical topics you should know:**
   
		1. Linear Algebra
      2. Probability Theory
      3. Calculus
      4. Statistics
      5. Calculus Of Variations
      6. Graph Theory
      7. Optimization Methods (Lagrange multipliers)
 
## 4. How should I go about learning this course?
    
   At first, I would suggest talking to professors and seniors who are already a part of machine learning projects. They should guide you enough about it.

   There are various courses available online
 
**That's it!**
